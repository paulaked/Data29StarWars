# Data 29 Star Wars Project

##Aims and Objectives

Using Python, write code to pull data on all available starships from the API.
The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship.
Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection, then insert the starships into their own collection in MongoDB.

## Instructions

to run the code make sure the starship collection does not exist (you may need to drop/ delete on mongodb). Otherwise, this will cause problems with the code. If error still exists you may need to restart MongoDB or the environment you are running.

- Next go into the "starwars" file and run the "starship.py" code. 
- Running the code will take a few minutes to execute completely. 
- You will know the code has run completely when the console displays "The starships have been added successfully".
- Check your MongoDB compass to see the collection labelled "Starship"

## Requirements

- Use good coding principles.  That means testing, appropriate comments, good naming conventions and handling errors gracefully.
- Follow PEP 8
- Create a job board in Trello or similar to keep track of your user stories.  Provide a link to that job board in your version of this README.
- Your code should utilise functional programming OR object-oriented programming
- Use Test Driven Development: write your tests first
- Good use of Git and GitHub. Commit and push often with meaningful commit messages.
- Include an appropriate version of this README

## Using this repo

- Branch off from main.
- Use your own name for the name of the branch (e.g. mine would be PaulaKedra - please copy this format).
- Make sure you commit and push to the remote repo frequently to keep your work up-to-date.
- The gitignore should catch most unnecessary project files, but do pay attention to what you are adding to the repo.
- Replace this README with an appropriate README for your project (including a link to your job board).
