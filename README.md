## NOTES FROM SHIBA
- [Link to Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jh2mMGWO/star-wars-project)
- Running code may take a few minutes
- Apologies for not transforming the collected dataset to a json file, and then saved to the folder; which would have made my life a lot easier
 - [PEP8 compliance checker](http://pep8online.com/) - alter_starships.py was put through this website to check whether it met PEP compliance. Changes were made and should now result to full compliance
