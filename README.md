# Tobi Salami's Star Wars Project

## Aim

The aim of this project is to be able to pull Starship data from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.tech/) and import this data into a MongoDB database. This is done through the use of functional/ object oriented	programming alongside Test Driven Development (TDD). For further information of aims and user stories go to:
